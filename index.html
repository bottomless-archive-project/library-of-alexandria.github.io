        the internet. We find it a noble task to
        save these documents for future generations.</p>

            <p class="lead">Library of Alexandria (LoA in short) is a project that aims to collect and archive documents
                from the internet.</p>
            <p class="lead">In our modern age new text documents are born in a blink of an eye then (often just as
                quickly) disappear from the internet. We find it a noble task to save these documents for future
                generations.</p>
            <p class="lead">This project aims to support this noble goal in a scalable way. We want to make the archival
                activity streamlined and easy to do even in a huge (Terabyte / Petabyte) scale. This way we hope that
                more and more people can start their own collection helping the archiving effort.</p>
